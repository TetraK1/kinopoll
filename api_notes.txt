data=data dict passed to serializer
is_valid does validation
save() essentially returns create() call
create essential returns model.create(data=data)

poll, question, option, and other poll design data structures should each have their own endpoints and be connected by hyperlinks as not a lot of cross-structure validation is needed and to make polls easily modifiable.  

responses, answers, and answer options should only be postable as responses when response validation can take place.  Getting individually might be allowable for result collation and processing.
